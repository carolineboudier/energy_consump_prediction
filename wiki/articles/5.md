# First look at our data
Be extra careful about the  **sampling** . 

Look at the columns description. 
- cooling_degree_days: cooling degree day for a given day is the number of degrees where the daily average temperature exceeds 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each month is summed to produce an annual total at the location of the building.
- heating_degree_days: heating degree day for a given day is the number of degrees where the daily average temperature falls under 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each month is summed to produce an annual total at the location of the building.

Identify the target column. Here = site_eui. Look at is distribution. 

 **Check**  : 
- Missing values (everything about the wind)
- Useless columns : id: building id, year_Factor (anonymized year in which the weather and energy usage factors were observed)
- Outliers : example = year column (built between year 0 and year 200)

Be careful about the  **schema** . The prepare recipe ([compute_full_data_prepared](recipe:compute_full_data_prepared)) automatically detects schema and allows to analyze all the columns. 

# Create a dashboard

Don't forget to remove the sampling // add a filter to make sure you only use data for which we have a label. 

 **Correlation matrix : ** 
- sort on the target variable. 
  - Notice that winter temperatures for the coldest months have a negative correlation. 
  - Notice that summer temperatures for the hottest months have a positive correlation
  - energy star rating is a great indicator
- finds groups of variables that are correlated together
  - average/min/max for a same month are correlated
  - also highly correlated with heating days 
  - wind direction // max wind speed very correlated

**Bivariate analysis**
- chose target as response variable
  - floor area
  
- do not hesitate to rebin the response
