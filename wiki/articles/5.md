# First look at our data
Be extra careful about the  **sampling** . 

Look at the columns description. 
Identify the target column. Here = site_eui. 

 **Check**  : 
- Missing values (everything about the wind)
- Useless columns : id: building id, year_Factor (anonymized year in which the weather and energy usage factors were observed)

Be careful about the  **schema** . The prepare recipe ([compute_full_data_prepared](recipe:compute_full_data_prepared)) automatically detects schema and allows to analyze all the columns. 

# Create a dashboard

Don't forget to remove the sampling // add a filter to make sure you only use data for which we have a label. 

 **Correlation matrix : ** 
- sort on the target variable. 
  - Notice that winter temperatures for the coldest months have a negative correlation. 
  - Notice that summer temperatures for the hottest months have a positive correlation
  - energy star rating is a great indicator
- finds groups of variables that are correlated together
  - average/min/max for a same month are correlated
  - also highly correlated with heating days 
  - wind direction // max wind speed very correlated

**Bivariate analysis**
- chose target as response variable
