# First look at our data
Be extra careful about the  **sampling** . 

Identify the target column. Here = site_eui. 

 **Check**  : 
- Missing values (everything about the wind)

Be careful about the  **schema** . The prepare recipe ([compute_full_data_prepared](recipe:compute_full_data_prepared)) automatically detects schema and allows to analyze all the columns. 

# Create a dashboard

 **Correlation matrix : ** 
- sort on the target variable. 
  - Notice that winter temperatures for the coldest months have a negative correlation. 
  - Notice that summer temperatures for the hottest months have a positive correlation
  - energy star rating is a great indicator
- finds groups of variables that are correlated together
  - average/min/max for a same month are correlated
  - also highly correlated with heating days 
  - wind direction // max wind speed very correlated
