# Objective

The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption.

The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE is commonly used measure of the differences between predicted values provided by a model and the actual observed values.

For every building (i.e. row) in the test dataset (test.csv), submission files should contain two columns: id and site_eui. id should be an integer andsite_eui should be a real value. For each row, these two values should be separated by a comma.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,site_eui
75757,1.3
75758,2.8
